# Social Security Registration

### European students

If you have a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), you don't need to register to the French social security. You can use your card and receive care in France. This card is issued in your country.

Students included are those with the nationality of a country of the European Union, Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway or Switzerland.

### Non-European students arriving in France

You must register to the French general social security system. Registration is done online by logging in to the website of the health insurance dedicated to foreign students.

The Procedure can be found online : [Social Security Registration](https://www.ameli.fr/yvelines/assure/droits-demarches/etudes-stages/etudiant/french-social-security-registration-process-foreign-students)

​This is a mandatory step. Make sure to download your social security attestation as soon as the process is over. The attestation will show your temporary social security number and is a proof of your coverage in case you need to seek any medical care.

Social Security provides foreign students with social coverage while studying in France. To increase the amount of their healthcare expenses that is reimbursed, they may take out complementary health insurance, or mutuelle.
