# Congratulations!

You have just learned the **mandatory administrative and basics tasks** you need to perform after comming to France. Other things you could do during the first month are :

- Go to the Admissions Department of your institute to obtain your timetable.
- Check out the library at your institute to make sure that your library card works properly (your student card often doubles as a library card).
- Also visit the CROUS department to get information on catering options, cultural activities and other benefits.
