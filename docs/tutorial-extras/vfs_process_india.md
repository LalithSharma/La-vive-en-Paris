## Campus France Visa Procedure

Please follow the steps below to complete your Campus France visa procedure:

### 1. Wait for Email Confirmation

- Only book your VFS appointment (maximum 3 months before your departure date) after receiving an auto-generated email from Alliance Française de Bombay.
- The email will confirm that your file has been completely reviewed/validated, and you may proceed with your visa application.

> Proceeding to the VFS without getting the email will only slow the process down for you. Print out the auto-generated email and attach it to your visa file in lieu of the Campus France NOC.

### 2. Download EEF Attestation

- Download the EEF attestation from your Campus France profile. This is a mandatory document.
- Log into [Campus France](https://pastel.diplomatie.gouv.fr/etudesenfrance) with your email and password.
- Scroll down and click on "1.1 >> Your application."
- At the right-hand corner, you will find a PDF document - "Attestation d'inscription/d'acceptances," which is the EEF attestation.
- Click on the document, and it opens with the heading "Accord Préalable d'inscription."
- Download and print the document to give to VFS.

### 3. Long Stay Visa Application Form

- Fill out the Long Stay Visa Application Form using the [France Visas website](https://france-visas.gouv.fr/en_US/web/france-visas).
- The form needs to be digitally filled and printed.

> **Note:** Please ensure that you follow these steps in the given order to facilitate a smooth visa application process.
